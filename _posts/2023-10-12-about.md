I am optimizing myself as a ⚛️ Quantum Algorithm Engineer. I keep my self-study notes publicly available in this website.

### Obsidian

These notes are managed locally using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). In order to make the most of this tool, it is recommended that you

1. Setup obsidian in your laptop
2. Download these notes
3. Open the notes under the `/_notes` folder
4. Explore the quantum theory concept graph
