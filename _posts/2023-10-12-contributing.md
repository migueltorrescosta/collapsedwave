Thank you 🙇‍♂️

If there is a topic that should be covered, do request it. I keep track of work that needs to be done via a GitHub project board, as a publicly visible learning process.

### 👩‍💻 Advanced contributors

You can submit your own contribution for review in [GitHub](https://github.com/migueltorrescosta/collapsedwave), following the contribution guidelines written in the README.md file. Since this process only requires a review to be accepted, it leads to a much faster addition to these notes.
