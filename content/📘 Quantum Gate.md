A Quantum gate represents an operation that can be applied on qubits. Given the [[ğŸ“˜ Block Sphere]] visualization of a [[qubit]]'s state, we can think of a quantum gate as the application of a rotation on the state of multiple qubits.

# Standard quantum gates

The notation for quantum gates has been mostly standardised. Examples include

| Symbol | Gate |
| ---: | :--- |
| X | [[ğŸ“˜ Pauli Matrix]] $\sigma_x$ |
| Y | [[ğŸ“˜ Pauli Matrix]] $\sigma_y$ |
| Z | [[ğŸ“˜ Pauli Matrix]] $\sigma_z$ |
| H | [[ğŸ“˜ Hadamard Gate]] |
| S | [[Phase gate]] |
| T | $\frac{\pi}{8}$ rotation gate |git
