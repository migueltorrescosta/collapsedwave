[[ðŸ“˜ Harmonic Oscillator]] where the [[force]] has an extra [[dampening factor]] $\lambda$ based on the velocity $v$. We get $F = -kx -\gamma \dot x$ . The relevant [[Equation of motion]] is $m \ddot x + \gamma \dot x + kx=0$, and the general solution is $x(t) = a \cos( \omega t) + b \sin ( \omega t)$, where

$m \in \mathbb{R}$ is the [[mass]]
$\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is the [[dampening factor]]
$\omega \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is the [[ðŸ“˜ Frequency of Oscillation]]
