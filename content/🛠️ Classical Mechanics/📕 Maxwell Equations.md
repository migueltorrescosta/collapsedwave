Maxwell equations describe the behaviour of the [[magnetic field]] and [[electric field]].

$$
\left \{
\begin{matrix}
\nabla \cdot E &=&\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} & \text{Gauss' law}\\
\nabla \cdot B &=& 0 & \text{Gauss' law for magnetism}\\
\nabla \times E &=& - \partial_t B & \text{Faraday's law of induction}\\
\nabla \times B &=& \mu_0 (J+\epsilon_0 \partial_t E) & \text{Ampere's circuital law}\\
\end{matrix}
\right .
$$
In the above,
- $E$ is the [[electric field]]
- $B$ is the [[magnetic field]]
- $J$ is the [[current density]]
- $\rho$ is the [[electric charge]]
- $\epsilon_0$ is the [[vacuum permittivity]]
- $\mu_0$ is the [[vacuum permeability]]
- $\nabla \cdot$ is the [[📘 Divergence]]
- $\nabla \times$ is the [[📘 Curl]]

I don't yet know the intuitive meaning behind each equation. [[Help me ❓]]
