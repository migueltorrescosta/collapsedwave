$(x_i p_j - x_j p_i)$ Gives us the Angular Momentum matrix for an arbitrary number of dimensions in matrix form. This matrix contains zeroes in the diagonal and is [[skew-symmetric]]. This allows us to simplify the representation of angular momentum in lower dimentions:

| Dimentions | Representation of angular momentum |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | It doesn't make sense to speak of 1-dimentional angular momentum |
| 2 | The scalar $x_2 p_1 - x_1 p_2$ suffices |
| 3 | The vector $[x_2p_3-x_3p_2, x_3p_1-x_1p_3, x_1p_2-x_2p_3]$ suffices |
