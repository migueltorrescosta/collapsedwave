$m\frac{d}{d t}v(t) = - \lambda v(t) + \mu (t)$ is the original Langevin [[ðŸ“˜ Master equation]]. It describes motion through a fluid, where the [[force]] $F=m \frac{d}{dt}v(t)$ is a function of
- A [[dampening factor]] $\lambda$ that acts against the [[velocity]] $v(t)$.
- A [[noise factor]] $\mu$, which is often described in terms of the [[ðŸ“˜ Wiener Process]].
