$$, where
- $\epsilon_0$ is the [[vacuum permittivity]].
- $\hbar$ is the [[reduced planck constant]]
- $m_e$ is the [[mass]] of an [[electron]]
- $e$ is the [[elementary charge]]
- $c$ is the [[speed]] of [[light]]
- $\alpha$ is the [[fine-structure constant]]

The Bohr radius is the most likely distance between the [[nucleus]] and the [[electron]] in the [[hydrogen atom]] when it is in a [[Ground state]].
