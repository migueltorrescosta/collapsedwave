The Quantum Hilbert Space is the [[ðŸ“˜ Vector Space#Hilbert Space]] used to represent [[quantum system state]]s.

# Operators
In all of the examples below,
- $\psi$ represents a [[wave function]]
- $\hbar$ represents [[Plancks reduced constant]]

## Position Operator
$\hat{X} \psi := x \psi$ 

## Momentum Operator
$\hat{P} \psi := -i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}$ 

>[!tip]
> This operator is thought of as giving us the linear momentum of a particle described by the [[unit vector]] $\psi$.



# Position and Momentum basis

In classical mechanics we keep track of a particle's position and momentum directly. In quantum mechanics particle's are described by their [[wave function]]. The [[wave function]] can be expressed in different orthonormal basis. Two commonly used basis are the position basis and the momentum basis. Both of these basis are continuous, represented by the $x$ and $p$ variables respectively, and in both cases taking values in $\mathbb{R}$.

# Properties

The results below are frequently useful when manipulating algebraic expressions related to quantum spaces

| Result | Comments |

| $\ket{\psi} = \int_{\infty}^{\infty}\ket{x}\braket{x \mid \psi}dx$ | Representation of a [[wave function]] $\psi$ in the position basis |

## The inner product of quantum states is time independent

$\braket{\phi(t) \mid \psi(t)}$ is independent of $t$ for 2 solutions $\psi, \phi$  of the same equation ( [[ðŸ“• Postulates of Quantum Mechanics#Postulate 4 Schrodinger's Equation]] )

>[!info]-
> 1. $\psi, \phi$ are time parameterized [[quantum state vector]] solutions to [[ðŸ“• Postulates of Quantum Mechanics#Postulate 4 Schrodinger's Equation]]
> 2. $\braket{ \cdot, \cdot } : H \times H \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is an [[ðŸ“˜ Inner Product]] on the [[ðŸ“˜ Vector Space#Quantum Hilbert Space]] 
> 3. $t \in \mathbb{R}^+$ denotes time.

> Hence $\frac{d}{dt}\braket{\phi, \psi}=0$, so the braket $\braket{\phi, \psi}$ is constant over time $t$
