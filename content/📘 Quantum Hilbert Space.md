The Quantum Hilbert Space is the [[ğŸ“˜ Vector Space#Hilbert Space]] used to represent [[quantum system state]]s.

# Operators
In all of the examples below,
- $\psi$ represents a [[wave function]]
- $\hbar$ represents [[Plancks reduced constant]]

## Position Operator
$\hat{X} \psi := x \psi$ 

## Momentum Operator
$\hat{P} \psi := -i \hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}$ 

>[!tip]
> This operator is thought of as giving us the linear momentum of a particle described by the [[unit vector]] $\psi$.



# Position and Momentum basis

In classical mechanics we keep track of a particle's position and momentum directly. In quantum mechanics particle's are described by their [[wave function]]. The [[wave function]] can be expressed in different orthonormal basis. Two commonly used basis are the position basis and the momentum basis. Both of these basis are continuous, represented by the $x$ and $p$ variables respectively, and in both cases taking values in $\mathbb{R}$.

# Properties

The results below are frequently useful when manipulating algebraic expressions related to quantum spaces
