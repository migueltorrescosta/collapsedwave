The [[ğŸ“˜ Hilbert Space]] representing a [[quantum system state]].

# Choosing a basis

In classical mechanics we keep track of a particle's position and momentum directly. In quantum mechanics particle's are described by their [[wave function]]. The [[wave function]] can be expressed in different orthonormal basis. Two commonly used basis are the position basis and the momentum basis. Both of these basis are continuous, represented by the $x$ and $p$ variables respectively, and in both cases taking values in $\mathbb{R}$.
