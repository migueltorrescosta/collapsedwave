In the experiment setup pictured below, we have Silver (Ag) atoms coming out of a furnace (1). Silver atoms have 47 electrons, 46 of which form a spherically symmetric structure. This results in atoms with a [[magnetic moment]] equal to the [[electron spin]] of the 47th electron. As the atoms go through the magnetic field below, they would follow a path determined by their [[magnetic moment]] along the $z$ direction.

1. Classically, we would expect the atoms to be continuously distributed as their [[Spin]] is uniformly distributed on the [[circle group]] $\mathbb{S}^1$. This is represented by (4) below
2. In practice, we observe only 2 dots where the atoms are observed. These match the electron having [[electron spin]] $S_z = \pm \frac{1}{2}\hbar$. This is known as the [[measurement problem]], where the [[wave function]] collapses upon [[measurement]]. The necessary collapse of the [[wave function]] is made more obvious in the [[ðŸ§ª Sequential Stern-Gerlach Experiment]].
