Decomposing operators is often useful as a way of building proofs and simplifying calculations. In this document we list different ways of decomposing matrices.


# Polar Decomposition
$A = UJ = KU$, with $U$ being a [[ðŸ“˜ Linear Operator#Unitary Operator]].

- $U$ is unique whenever $A$ is invertible
- $J = \sqrt{AA^{\dagger}}$ , $K=\sqrt{A^{\dagger}A}$ , which is generally not unique.
