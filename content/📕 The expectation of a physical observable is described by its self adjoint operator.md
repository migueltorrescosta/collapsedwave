If a [[quantum system]] is described by a [[quantum state vector]] $\psi \in H$, the probability distribution of the [[ðŸ“˜ Classical observable]] $f$ is given by $\mathbb{E}[f^m] = \braket{\psi, ( \hat{f} )^m \psi}$

> 1. $f : \mathbb{R}^{2n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a [[ðŸ“˜ Classical observable]]
> 2. $\hat{f}: \mathbb{C}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n$ is the corresponding [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum observable]]
> 3. $\psi$ is a [[unit vector]]

>[!tip]
> Although we are in a quantum state space, we still care about measuring [[ðŸ“˜ Classical observable]] values. Rather than having a deterministic [[ðŸ“˜ Classical observable]] value, a [[quantum system state]] gives us a probability distribution for the classical counterpart.
