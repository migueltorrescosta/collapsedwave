The adjoint $A^\star : H \rightarrow H$ of an operator $A$ is defined by the relation $\braket{Ax, y} = \braket{x, A^\star y} \forall x,y \in H$. Uniqueness and existence of $A^\star$ are assured by [[Riesz Representation Theorem]].

> 1. $H$ is an [[ðŸ“˜ Hilbert Space]] 
> 2. $\braket{ \cdot , \cdot }$ is an [[ðŸ“˜ Inner Product]] on $H$. We follow the Physics convention that an Inner Product is linear on the 2nd variable.
> 3. $A$ is an [[Operator]]
> 4. The adjoint might be written as $A^\star$ (maths) or $A^\dagger$ ( physics ). It might also be called the Hermitian Adjoint.
