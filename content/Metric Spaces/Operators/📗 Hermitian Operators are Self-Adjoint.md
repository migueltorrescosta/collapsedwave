By definition, if $A$ is an [[ðŸ“˜ Hermitian Operator]] then $A^*=A$. In particular, $A^*$ had the same domain as $A$, so $A: \braket{Ax, y} = \braket{x, Ay}, \forall x,y \in H$, making $A$ a [[ðŸ“˜ Self-Adjoint Operator]] operator.

Take the [[ðŸ“˜ Position Operator]] $X$ as an example, defined with support on the [[Schwartz Space]] with support on $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 1}$. $X$ has full support in this space as $\|Xf \|_2 = \int_{\mathbb{R}_{\geq 1}}x^2\|f(x)\|dx$, and any function $f$ in the [[Schwartz Space]] decays faster than any polynomial.
