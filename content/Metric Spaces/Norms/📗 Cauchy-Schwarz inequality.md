$\| \braket{v,w} \| \leq \| v \| \| w \|$ 

>[!info]-
> 1. $\braket{ \cdot, \cdot }$ is an [[üìò Inner Product]]
> 2. $v,w$ are vectors
> 3. $\| v \| := \sqrt{\braket{v,v}}$ is the [[üìò Norm]] induced by the [[üìò Inner Product]]

>[!success] Proof
> I want to write this proof neatly, but I haven't decided yet on the best way to do so ([[Help me ‚ùì]]). In the meantime, see [the Wikipedia proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality#Proofs)
