More specifically, $\forall x \in X$ we have that $p(x) > 0$.

1. By [[absolute homogeneity]] , $p(-x) = \| 1 \| p(x) = p(x)$ 
3. By the [[triangle inequality]], $p(0) \leq p(x) + p(-x)$.
4. By [[absolute homogeneity]] , $p(0) = \| 0 \| p(0) = 0$ 
5. Joining results, $0=p(0) \leq p(x) + p(-x) = 2p(x)$, so $p(x) \geq 0$
