The set of points where a [[ðŸ“˜ Constant of Motion]] is kept constant. Using [[ðŸ“˜ Total Energy]] as the [[ðŸ“˜ Constant of Motion]], we get the example of a level curve as the set

$$\{ (x,\dot x) \in \mathbb{R}^{2n} \mid E(x,\dot x) = E(x_0, \dot x_0) \}$$

If a [[ðŸ“˜ Level Curve]] contains no [[Critical Points]], then the [[Implicit Function Theorem]] proves that we have a [[Smooth Curve]].
