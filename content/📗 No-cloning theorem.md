It is impossible to create an independent copy of a given [[qubit]] in an unknown state $\ket{\psi}$.

> [!success]
> All actions on a [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum Hilbert Space]] can be represented by unitary operators. No unitary operator can transform $\ket{\psi} \times \ket{\phi}$ into $\ket{\psi} \times \ket{\psi}$ for all possible inputs $\ket{\psi} \times \ket{\phi} \in H \times H$. Hence, there is no transformation that clones a [[qubit]].
