For an operator $A : H \rightarrow H$, for $H$ finite dimensional, the definitions of [[📘 Self Adjoint Operator]], [[Hermitian Operation]] and [[📘 Symmetric Operator]] are equivalent.
### 💭 Intuition
The subtle differences in these definitions become relevant when we work with an infinite dimensional [[📘 Hilbert Space]], where a [[Linear Operator]] might not be bounded.
### 🧠 Proof
