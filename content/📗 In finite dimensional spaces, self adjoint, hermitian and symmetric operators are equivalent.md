For an operator $A : H \rightarrow H$, for $H$ finite dimensional, the definitions of [[📘 Linear Operator#Self Adjoint Operator]], [[📘 Hermitian Operator]] and [[📘 Linear Operator#Symmetric Operator]] are equivalent.

>[!tip]
> The subtle differences in these definitions become relevant when we work with an infinite dimensional [[📘 Vector Space#Hilbert Space]], where a [[Linear Operator]] might not be bounded.

>[!success] Proof
> I need to find neat proofs of this. [[Help me❓]]
