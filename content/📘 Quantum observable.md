An operator $\hat{f}$ on the [[📘 Quantum Hilbert Space]] corresponding to a [[📘 Classical observable]] $f$, as per the axiom: [[📕 All classical real valued functions have an associated self adjoint operator]]
### ✍️ Notation
- $f : \mathbb{R}^{2n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a [[📘 Classical observable]]
- $\hat{f}: \mathbb{C}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the corresponding [[📘 Quantum observable]]
