If we measure a [[quantum state vector]] $\psi$ with result $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, Then immediately after the [[measurement]], the system will be in a state $\psi'$ satisfying $$\hat{f} \psi ' = \lambda \psi'$$
>[!info]-
> $\hat{f}$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Linear Operator#Self Adjoint Operator]] associated with $f$.
