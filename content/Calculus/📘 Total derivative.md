Total derivatives are often written as $\frac{df}{dt}$, not to be confused with a [[Partial Derivative]] .

I want to write or link to a nice explanation that distinguishes the 2 types of derivatives. [[Help me ‚ùì]]

# Lookup table

Below are some useful derivation rules:

| $F$ | $F'$ |
| ---- | ---- |
| $f \circ g$ | $( f' \circ g ) \times g'$ |
| $fg$ | $f'g + g'f$ |
| $\frac{f}{g}$ | $\frac{f'g-g'f}{g^2}$ |
