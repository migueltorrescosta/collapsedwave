Quantum Field Theory joins the ideas behind [[quantum theory]] and special relativity. There are multiple field theories that apply to different forces:

| Theory | Force |
| ---- | ---- |
| QED: Quantum Electrodynamics | Electromagnetic force |
| QCD: Quantum Chromodynamics | Strong nuclear force |
| Electroweak Theory | Weak nuclear force |

There is yet to be found a quantum theory of gravity. A good overview over attempts made to unify physical theories is provided by the cGh cube
