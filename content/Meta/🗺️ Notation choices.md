 There is variability in the way authors write their mathematics and physics. In this webpage we've made some choices:

# Hat operators
Hat over operators, such as $\hat \rho$ and $\hat U_t^\dagger$, are often skipped in favour of $\rho$ and $U_t^\dagger$. I try to make operators clear from context, and writing the hat on top of every symbol is time consuming.

# Super / sub scripts
Indices are subscript, powers are superscripts.

It takes as much work to write $K_\alpha$ as it does $K^\alpha$. This standardisation allows me to immediately know that $K_\alpha$ is the $K$ operator indexed by $\alpha$, whereas $K^\alpha$ is $K$ to the power of $\alpha$. If we have multiple scripts, we can keep them ordered, for example as $K_{ijkl}$.

# Integrands
We always use $dt$ as one of the delimiters of the integrand, i.e. we always write $\int t^2dt$ and never $\int dt t^2$. This choice clarifies what the integrand is, for instance, $\int_0^t\rho ds$ is the integral with integrand $\rho(s)$, even though we decided to omit the parameterization of $\rho$ as a function of $s$.

# "Identity" function
I often use the function $\mathbb{I}_A =  \begin{cases}1 & \text{ if } x \in A \\0 & \text{ if } x \notin A \end{cases}$ in unusual places. This notation is very powerful as it is easy to memorise, and it replaces a lot of custom functions, such as: 

- Heaviside step function: $\theta(x) = \mathbb{I}_{x \geq 0}$
- Kronecker delta: $\delta_{ij} = \mathbb{I}_{ i = j }$ 
- Step function: $\mathbb{I}_{x \in [0,1]}$ 

It also come very handy as a way of preventing the branching of equations: I can write any branched equation

$f(x) = \begin{cases}g(x) & \text{ if } x \in B \\h(x) & \text{ if } x \in C \end{cases}$

where $B \cap C = \varnothing$  as $f(x) = g(x)\mathbb{I}_{x \in B} + h(x)\mathbb{I}_{x \in C}$. I find the latter easier to reason with during algebraic manipulations.
