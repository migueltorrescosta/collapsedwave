As students, we get access to a lot of tools as a learning opportunity. Some of the tools that I highly recommend:
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/): A very powerful but hard to learn IDE, designed to have all parts of your software development cycle 5 key strokes away.
- [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack): A selection by GitHub of tools useful for many different careers, from frontend / backend design, to DevOps, to DataScience.
