The topics of the classes are spread over multiple notes. For each class below, I summarise and link to the topics covered

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
lecturer as Lecturer,
file.link as Class
FROM "ðŸŽ“ Classes"
WHERE lecturer
sort Class ASC
```

# Questions to ask

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
" (" + length(rows.inlink) + ") " + inlink as Class,
join(rows.file.link, ", ") as Mentions

FLATTEN file.inlinks as inlink
FLATTEN file.outlinks as outlink

WHERE contains(inlink.file.folder, "Classes")
AND contains(outlink.file.name, "Help me")

GROUP BY inlink
SORT length(rows.file.link) DESC
SORT file.name ASC
LIMIT 3
```
