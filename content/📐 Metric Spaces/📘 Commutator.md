$[A, B] := AB - BA$ is defined to be the commutator between operators $A$ and $B$.

# Properties

- $[A, B] = - [B, A]$: [[ðŸ“— Commutators are anti-commutative]]
- $[xA + yB, C] = x[A, C] + y[B,C]$: [[ðŸ“— Commutators are bilinear]]
- $[A, BC] = [A,B]C + B[A,C]$: [[ðŸ“— Matrix multiplication distributes over commutation]]
- $[A, [B,C]] + [B, [C,A]] + [C, [A,B]] = 0$: [[ðŸ“— Commutators satisfy the Jacobi Identity]]
