$A: A = A^\dagger$, where $A^\dagger$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Adjoint Operator]]. In particular, [[ğŸ“˜ Self-Adjoint Operator]]s are [[ğŸ“˜ Symmetric Operator]] where the [[Domain]] of $A$ and of $A^\dagger$ are equal.

# Properties
- [[ğŸ“— Hermitian Operators are Self-Adjoint]]
- [[ğŸ“— In finite dimensional spaces, hermitian = symmetric = self-adjoint]]
