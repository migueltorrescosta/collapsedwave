$A: A = A^*$, where $A$ is an operator over the complex [[ğŸ“˜ Vector field]] $\mathbb{C}$

# Properties
- [[ğŸ“— Hermitian Operators are Self-Adjoint]]
- [[ğŸ“— All operators can be decomposed into hermitian and anti-hermitian components]]
- [[ğŸ“— In finite dimensional spaces, hermitian = symmetric = self-adjoint]]
