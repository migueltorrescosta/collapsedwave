$A: A = A^\dagger$, where $A$ is an operator over the complex [[ğŸ“˜ Vector field]] $\mathbb{C}$ and $A^\dagger$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Adjoint Operator]].

# Properties
- [[ğŸ“— Hermitian Operators are Self-Adjoint]]
- [[ğŸ“— All operators can be decomposed into hermitian and anti-hermitian components]]
- [[ğŸ“— In finite dimensional spaces, hermitian = symmetric = self-adjoint]]
