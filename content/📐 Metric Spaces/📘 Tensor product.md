$V \bigotimes W$ is the tensor product of [[ðŸ“˜ Vector Space]]s $V$ and $W$.

It is built by constructing the [[ðŸ“˜ Cartesian Product]] $Z := \{ v \bigotimes w :v \in V, w \in W  \}$, where $v \bigotimes w$ can be seen as representing the pair $(v,w)$ and taking the [[Quotient Space]] of $Z$ with the [[relation]]s:
1. $v_1 \bigotimes w + v_2 \bigotimes w = (v_1 + v_2) \bigotimes w$
2. $v \bigotimes w_1 + v \bigotimes w_2 = v \bigotimes (w_1 + w_2)$
3. $\lambda ( v \bigotimes w) = (\lambda v) \bigotimes w = v \bigotimes (\lambda w)$
In the above $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$, where $V$ and $W$ are [[module]]s over the [[field]] $\mathbb{F}$.
