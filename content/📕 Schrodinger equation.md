$\frac{d\psi}{dt} = \frac{1}{i\hbar}\hat{H}\psi$ defines the time evolution of a [[quantum state vector]] $\psi$

There are many formulations of the above, for distinct [[ğŸ“˜ Hamiltonian Operator]]s. As an example, the position space schrÃ¶dinger equation for a single nonrelativistic particle is: $$ih\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \left [ - \frac{h}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t) \right ] \Psi(x,t) $$
