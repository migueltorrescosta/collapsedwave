Master equations describe the time evolution of a system, which might be deterministic or probabilistic in nature. This is usually represented by a [[transition rate matrix]]. In the context of [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum Dynamical Semigroup]]s, this matrix corresponds to the [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum Dynamical Semigroup generator]].
