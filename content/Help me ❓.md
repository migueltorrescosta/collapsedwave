I refer to this note whenever there are concepts I still need to clarify, and often understand myself. If any of it is clear to you, feel free to reach out directly. I am usually reachable via
- GitHub, where you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/migueltorrescosta/collapsedwave/issues/new/choose)
- Slack, where we use the Collapsed Wave workspace to discuss anything Quantum related. Feel free to [join via URL](https://join.slack.com/t/collapsedwave/shared_invite/zt-29mb5r529-OiAjWcQKDGbN_GuiIjx2gw)
