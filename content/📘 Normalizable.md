A function $f$ on a metric space $(X, \| \cdot \|)$ is normalizable iff $\|f\| \in \mathbb{R}^+$.

This property is often required of the [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum state]] of a system, in order for it to have physical meaning, which means $\| \psi \|_{L_2} = \int_\mathbb{R} |\psi(x) |^2 dx \in \mathbb{R}^+$, where $L_2$ is the set of [[square-integrable functions]].
