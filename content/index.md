Collapsed Wave contains my published study notes. I hope it will become useful to others as a glossary of Quantum Theory and Machine Learning concepts. Notes are meant to be succinct, with details provided through linked pages, and easily searchable through the search bar.

- The ( many ) topics I want to better understand are aggregated by a single note: [[Help me ❓]]
- I hope you find the [[🗺️ Notation choices]] made reasonable, even if some are unconventional.
- You can follow ongoing work by subscribing to the [RSS Feed](https://collapsedwave.com/index.xml).
- I would be delighted to see direct contributions to this glossary. The contribution process is described in the [repo's README.me](https://github.com/migueltorrescosta/collapsedwave/blob/main/README.md) file. All contributors are automatically listed [here](https://github.com/migueltorrescosta/collapsedwave/graphs/contributors).
- I keep a [[🦅 Core Dashboard]] to quickly see work in progress, broken tags and other useful information at a glance. Unfortunately dashboards do not render well as a web page.
- I try to clarify the contents of the note through the icons below:

| Icon | Type                  |
