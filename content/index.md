Hey 👋 Collapsed Wave is a glossary of notes around Machine Learning and Quantum Theory. This is meant to make easy to look up any definitions and clarify concepts, as finding notes is easy using the Search Bar. This is not meant as to be a good way to learn these materials, if you're seeing them for the first time.
1. To learn these topics, I would recommend books such as [[Quantum Theory for Mathematicians]]
2. To explore notes, the [[📕 Postulate 4 - Schrodinger Equation]] is as good as any to get started with.

This is a work in progress. You can see the ( many ) parts I still need to improve aggregated on a single note: [[Help me ❓]]
