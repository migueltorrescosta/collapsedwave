A system is said to follow [[ğŸ“˜ Markovian Dynamics]], or posses the [[ğŸ“˜ Markovian Dynamics|Markov property]], if the time evolution is described by a time-invariant operator. Applied to the context of [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum Dynamical Semigroup]]s, this means that the associated [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum Dynamical Semigroup generator]] is time-independent.
