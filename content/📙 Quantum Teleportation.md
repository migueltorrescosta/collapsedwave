Quantum states can propagate faster than light by applying the following steps:

1. Prepare an [[EPR]] pair of [[qubit]]s $A$ and $B$, where $A$ is sent to Alice and $B$ to Bob.
2. Given a [[qubit]] $C$ with original state $\ket{\psi}$ owned by Alice, entangle $A$ and $C$ by using a [[CNOT]] and [[📘 Quantum Gate#Hadamard Gate]]s. 
3. Alice measures $A$ and $C$.
4. The original state of $\ket{\psi}$ has now been propagated to $B$, with the information needed to obtain the state $\ket{\psi}$ dependent on the results of the measurements of $A$ and $C$. The transmission of the classical bits resulting from the measurements ensures that the speed of light has not been violated.

I need to flesh out the details above. [[Help me❓]].
