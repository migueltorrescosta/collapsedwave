$\Phi : B(H) \rightarrow B(G)$ is a Dynamical Map between [[trace class operators]] on  [[📘 Hilbert Space]]s $H$ and $G$ if:
- $\mathrm{Tr}[\Phi(\rho)] \leq 1$ for any [[📘 Density matrix]] $\rho$.
- $\Phi$ is [[📘 Completely Positive]]


It is unclear why we need the Dynamical Map to operate between [[trace class operators]]. [[Help me ❓]]
