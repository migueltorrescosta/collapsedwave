$\| \braket{v,w} \| \leq \| v \| \| w \|$ 

### ✍️ Notation
- $\braket{ \cdot, \cdot }$ is an [[📘 Inner Product]]
- $v,w$ are vectors
- $\| v \| := \sqrt{\braket{v,v}}$ is the [[📘 Norm]] induced by the [[📘 Inner Product]]

### 🧠 Proof
[[🏗️ To be completed]]. In the meantime, see [the Wikipedia proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality#Proofs)
