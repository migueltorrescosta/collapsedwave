Given a [[ðŸ“˜ Trie]] and a string $s$ of length $k$, we can return a pointer to the subtree associated with it in $O(k)$ time.

> $O(k)$ follows [[O-notation]]

>[!success]
> We traverse the [[ðŸ“˜ Trie]] following the characters given by the prefix. Following a link is $O(1)$, and we have to follow $k$ links $\blacksquare$.
