$( \Delta_\psi X ) ( \Delta_\psi P ) \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$

The above shows that the product of uncertainties in measurement between the [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum Hilbert Space#Position Operator]] and the [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum Hilbert Space#Momentum Operator]] is bounded below. The relation applies to any pair of [[ðŸ“˜ Conjugate variable]]s, and follows from the [[ðŸ“˜ Fourier Transform#Uncertainty principle]], since [[ðŸ“˜ Conjugate variable]]s are related to each other by being the fourier transform of each other, up to a constant defined in terms of [[Plancks reduced constant]] $\hbar$ .
