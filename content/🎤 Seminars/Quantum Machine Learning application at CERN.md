 **"Quantum Machine Learning application at CERN"**  
Dr. Michele Grossi

**Thursday 29/2/2024** **14:30**  
Aula A, Dipartimento di Fisica  

CERN has started its Quantum Technology Initiative in order to investigate the use of quantum technologies in High Energy Physics (HEP). A three-year roadmap and research programme has been defined in collaboration with the HEP and quantum-technology research communities. In this context, initial pilot projects have been set up at CERN in collaboration with other HEP institutes worldwide on Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning in particular. This talk will provide an overview of recent results obtained by the different studies, focusing on current usage of quantum machine learning techniques for HEP use cases and beyond.
