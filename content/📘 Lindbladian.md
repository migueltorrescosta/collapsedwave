$\mathbb{L}[\rho] = - \frac{i}{\hbar} [ \hat H, \hat \rho ] + \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{N^2-1} L_\alpha (\hat K^\alpha \rho (\hat K^\alpha)^\dagger) - \frac{1}{2} \{ (\hat K^\alpha)^\dagger \hat K^\alpha, \hat \rho \} )$, where
- $\mathbb{L}$ is the [[📘 Quantum Dynamical Semigroup generator]]
- $L_\alpha := \sqrt{C^\alpha} \hat K^\alpha$  are the [[📘 Lindblad Operator]]s.
- $C^\alpha$ are [[positive operator]]s. This follows from the [[📘 Quantum Dynamical Semigroup]] generated by $\mathbb{L}$ being [[📘 Completely Positive]]. I need to write down this proof. [[Help me ❓]]

The Lindbladian generalizes the [[📕 Postulate 4 - Schrodinger Equation]] to [[open quantum system]]s. In this context, the time evolution is no longer described by [[📘 Unitary Operator]]s.
