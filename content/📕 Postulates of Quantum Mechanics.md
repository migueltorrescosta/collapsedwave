The postulates below form the core beliefs behind quantum theory

# Postulate 1
A [[quantum system state]] is represented by a [[unit vector]] $\psi$ in a [[ğŸ“˜ Vector Space#Quantum Hilbert Space]] $H$.

These are unique up to multiples of unity, i.e. $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ represent the same physical state whenever $\exists c \in \mathbb{C}, \| c \| = 1$ such that $\psi_1 = c \psi_2$ .

# Postulate 2
Given a [[ğŸ“˜ Classical observable]] $f: \mathbb{R}^{2n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ on the classical [[ğŸ“˜ Vector Space#Phase Space]], there is an associated [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum observable]] $\hat{f} : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, described by a [[ğŸ“˜ Linear Operator#Self Adjoint Operator]] on the associated [[ğŸ“˜ Vector Space#Quantum Hilbert Space]]. 
# Postulate 3
If we measure a [[quantum state vector]] $\psi$ with result $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, Then immediately after the [[measurement]], the system will be in a state $\psi'$ satisfying $$\hat{f} \psi ' = \lambda \psi'$$
>[!info]-
> $\hat{f}$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Linear Operator#Self Adjoint Operator]] associated with $f$. 

## Property

If a [[quantum system]] is described by a [[quantum state vector]] $\psi \in H$, the probability distribution of the [[ğŸ“˜ Classical observable]] $f$ is given by $\mathbb{E}[f^m] = \braket{\psi, ( \hat{f} )^m \psi}$

>[!info]-
> 1. $f : \mathbb{R}^{2n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a [[ğŸ“˜ Classical observable]]
> 2. $\hat{f}: \mathbb{C}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n$ is the corresponding [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum observable]]
> 3. $\psi$ is a [[unit vector]]

>[!tip]
> Although we are in a quantum state space, we still care about measuring [[ğŸ“˜ Classical observable]] values. Rather than having a deterministic [[ğŸ“˜ Classical observable]] value, a [[quantum system state]] gives us a probability distribution for the classical counterpart.



# Postulate 4: Schrodinger's Equation
$\frac{d\psi}{dt} = \frac{1}{i\hbar}\hat{H}\psi$ defines the time evolution of a [[quantum state vector]] $\psi$

There are many formulations of the above, for distinct [[ğŸ“˜ Hamiltonian Operator]]s. As an example, the position space schrÃ¶dinger equation for a single nonrelativistic particle is: $$ih\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \left [ - \frac{h}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t) \right ] \Psi(x,t) $$
>[!info]-
> - $H$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Hamiltonian Operator]] 
> - $\hat{H}$ is the associated [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum observable]]
> - $\hbar$ is [[Plancks reduced constant]]
> - $V$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Potential energy]]
