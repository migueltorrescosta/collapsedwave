$$
\epsilon_{\sigma (n)} =
\left \{
\begin{array}{rl}
1 & \text{If $\sigma_n$ is an even permutation}\\
-1 & \text{If $\sigma_n$ is an odd permutation}\\
\end{array}
\right .
$$
In the above we have
- $S_n$ is the [[permutation group]] of size $n$
- $\sigma_n \in S_n$ is an element of the [[permutation group]]
- The [[parity]] of a [[permutation]] $\sigma$ ( i.e. being even/odd) is defined via the [[parity]] of transpositions needed to decompose the [[permutation]] $\sigma$.
