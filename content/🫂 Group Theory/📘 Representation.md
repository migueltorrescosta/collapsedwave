A representation $( \pi, V)$ of a [[group]] $G$ is a pair consisting of a [[ğŸ“˜ Vector Space]] $V$ and an [[ğŸ“˜ Homomorphism]] $\pi : G \rightarrow V$. A representation allows us to treat an abstract group $G$ by representing it as a subset of elements in the more familiar context of [[ğŸ“˜ Vector Space]]s.
