An [[exact sequence]] of the form $0 \rightarrow A \xrightarrow{f} B \xrightarrow{g} C \rightarrow 0$, where $f$ ang $g$ are [[ðŸ“˜ Homomorphism]]s Since this is an [[exact sequence]], we have that:
- $f$ is a [[monomorphism]], i.e. it is an [[injective]] [[ðŸ“˜ Homomorphism]].
- $g$ is an [[epimorphism]], i.e. it is a [[surjective]] [[ðŸ“˜ Homomorphism]].
- $im {f} = \ker {g}$, i.e. the [[image]] of $f$ equals the [[kernel]] of $g$.
