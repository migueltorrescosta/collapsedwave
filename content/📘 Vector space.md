A non empty set $V$ over a [[field]] $F$ satisfying with 2 [[binary operation]]s, commonly denoted as $+$ and $\times$, satisfying:

| Axiom | Description |
| ---: | --- |
| $u+(v+w)=(u+v)+w$ | addition of vectors is associative |
| $u+v=v+u$ | Addition is commutative |
| $\exists 0 \in V : v+0 = v \forall v \in V$ | There is an additive identity vector $0 \in V$ |
| $\forall v \in V \exists (-v) : (-v)+v = 0$ | All vectors have an additive inverse |
| $a(bv) = (ab)v$ | Scalar multiplications is associative with field multiplication |
| $1v=v$ | There is a multiplicative identity scalar $1 \in F$ |
| $a(u+v) = au + av$ | Scalar multiplication is distributive over vector addition |
| $(a+b)V = av + bv$ | Scalar multiplication is distributive over field addition |
