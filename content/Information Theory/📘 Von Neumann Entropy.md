The Von Neumann Entropy is a generalisation of [[📘 Shannon Entropy]], useful for analysing the amount of information present in a [[qubit]]. It is given as a function of the [[density matrix]] $\rho$, namely $H(\rho) = - tr ( \rho\ln \rho )$.

The value of $\ln \rho$ is given by the generalisation of the $\ln$ operator to matrices. One way of doing this is to diagonalise the density matrix, take the logarithms along the diagonal, and change the basis back to the original one. I need to explain why we can diagonalise the matrix, or find a better explanation of $\ln \rho$. [[Help me ❓]].

For a density matrix $\rho$ equivalent to a pure quantum state, the Von Neumann Entropy matches [[📘 Shannon Entropy]].
