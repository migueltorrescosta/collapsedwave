A [[force]] $F$ is called conservative iff $\exists V: F = - \nabla V$

>[!info]-
> 1. $V$ is the associated [[ðŸ“˜ Potential energy]]
> 2. $\nabla V$ is the [[ðŸ“˜ Del or Nabla]] of $V$

>[!tip]
> For a [[force]] $F(x) : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ with no dependency on the [[velocity]] $v = \dot x$, [[ðŸ“˜ Total Energy]] is constant only if the [[force]] is conservative
