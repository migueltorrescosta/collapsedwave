I.e. $\braket{\mathcal{F} f, \mathcal{F} g} = \braket{f,g} \forall f,g$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the [[ðŸ“˜ Fourier Transform]] and $f,g$ are arbitrary functions in $\mathcal{L}^2(\mathbb{F})$ for $\mathbb{F}$ being either the [[field]] of reals or complex numbers.

# Proof

Since [[ðŸ“— Fourier tranform's inverse is it's adjoint]], we have $\braket{\mathcal{F}f, \mathcal{F}g} = \braket{\mathcal{F}^\dagger \mathcal{F}f, g} = \braket{f, g}$. Since all [[ðŸ“˜ Inner Product]]s are preserved, so are [[ðŸ“˜ Distance]]s, showing that the [[ðŸ“˜ Fourier Transform]] is an [[ðŸ“˜ Isometry]].
