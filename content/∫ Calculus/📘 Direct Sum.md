$V \bigoplus W$ is the direct sum of [[ðŸ“˜ Vector Space]]s $V$ and $W$.

It is built by constructing the space $Z := \{ v \bigoplus w :v \in V, w \in W  \}$, where $v \bigoplus w$ can be seen as representing the pair $(v,w)$ and taking the [[Quotient Space]] of $Z$ with the [[relation]]s spanned by:
1. $v_1 \bigoplus w_1 + v_2 \bigoplus w_2 = (v_1 + v_2) \bigoplus (w_1 + w_2)$
3. $\lambda ( v \bigoplus w) = (\lambda v) \bigoplus (\lambda w)$
