	NPHARD : NP-Hard
	NPCOMPLETE : NP-Complete
	
	NPCOMPLETE --> NPHARD
	NPCOMPLETE --> NP
	P --> NP
```

Relevant groups include:
- [[NP-Complete]]
- [[NP-Hard]]
- [[P]]
- [[NP]]
- [[EQP]] ( Exact Quantum Polynomial )
- [[BQP]] ( Bounded error Quantum Polynomial )
- [[BPP]] ( Bounded error classical polynomial )
