A [[📘 Completely Positive]] Trace Preserving [[📘 Dynamical Map]] $\Phi$. The trace preserving property means that for any [[📘 Statistical Operator]] $\rho$, which by definition has [[Trace]] 1, the [[📘 Statistical Operator]] $\Phi [\rho] $ also has [[Trace]] 1.

I don't know if a [[📘 Quantum Channel]] needs to preserve the trace of operators when their trace is zero. [[Help me ❓]]
