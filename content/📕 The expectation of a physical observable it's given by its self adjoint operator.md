If a [[quantum system]] is described by a [[quantum state vector]] $\psi \in H$, the probability distribution of the [[📘 Classical observable]] $f$ is given by $\mathbb{E}[f^m] = \braket{\psi, ( \hat{f} )^m \psi}$
### ✍️ Notation
- $f : \mathbb{R}^{2n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a [[📘 Classical observable]]
- $\hat{f}: \mathbb{C}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n$ is the corresponding [[📘 Quantum observable]]
- $\psi$ is a [[unit vector]]
### 💭 Intuition
1. Although we are in a quantum state space, we still care about measuring [[📘 Classical observable]] values
2. Rather than having a deterministic [[📘 Classical observable]] value, a [[quantum system state]] gives us a probability distribution for the classical counterpart.
