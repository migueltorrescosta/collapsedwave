Reduced Dynamics are an approximation of the evolution of a [[quantum system]], where we have applied the [[ðŸ“˜ Partial Trace]] over the environment.

More formally, this is a [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum Dynamical Semigroup]] $\{T_t \}_{t \geq 0}$ that attempts to make the diagram below commutative. This is only an attempt, as the [[ðŸ“˜ Reduced system]] does not contain all the information needed for commutativity to hold.

	rho_0 --> rho_t : Unitary transformation
	rho_0 --> rho_S,0 : Tracing over the environment
	rho_t --> rho_S,t : Tracing over the environment
	rho_S,0 --> rho_S,t : Reduced Dynamics
```

Where we use the notation:
- $\rho_0$ for the initial [[ðŸ“˜ Statistical Operator|Density Matrix]] of the full system
- $\rho_t := U_t\rho_0U_t^\dagger$ for the evolving [[ðŸ“˜ Statistical Operator|Density Matrix]] of the full system.
- $\rho_{S,0}:= \mathrm{Tr}^E[\rho_0]$ for the initial [[ðŸ“˜ Statistical Operator|Density Matrix]] of the [[ðŸ“˜ Reduced system]].
- $\rho_{S,t} := \mathrm{Tr}^E[\rho_t]$ for the evolving [[ðŸ“˜ Statistical Operator|Density Matrix]] of the [[ðŸ“˜ Reduced system]].
