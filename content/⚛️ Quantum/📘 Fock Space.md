$F_\nu(H) := \overline{\bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty}S_\mu H^{\bigotimes n}}$ , where

- $H^{ \bigotimes n}$ represents an [[📘 Quantum Hilbert Space]] with $n$ particles
- $S_\mu$ represents the symmetrization or antisymetrization of a [[tensor]]. I need to clarify what this means. [[Help me ❓]].
- $\bigoplus$ describes the [[📘 Direct Sum]] of [[📘 Hilbert Space]]s
- $\overline{V}$ represents the [[closure]] of a [[📘 Hilbert Space]] $V$.

The fock space allows us to act on spaces with a varying number of particles through the use of [[annihilation operator]]s and [[creation operator]]s. I need to define these. [[Help me ❓]]
