A Bloch Sphere is a representation of a [[qubit]]. Any [[ðŸ“˜ Density matrix]] can be represented as in the shape $\rho = \frac{1}{2} ( I + \overrightarrow{r} \cdot \sigma )$, where $\overrightarrow{r} = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \in \mathbb{C}^3$ and $\sigma = [ \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z ]$ are the [[ðŸ“˜ Pauli Matrix]]es.
