$H \ket{\psi} = E\ket{\psi}$, where
- $H$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Hamiltonian Operator]]
- $E \in \mathbb{R}$ is the [[eigenvalue]], also known as the [[energy]] of the [[ğŸ“˜ Eigenstate]].

The time-independent [[ğŸ“• Postulate 4 - Schrodinger Equation]] is easier to solve, and it provides the eigenstates useful for describing the general solution.

# Properties
- [[The energy level in a Hamiltonian is always real valued]]
- [[Eigenstates of the time independent schrodinger equation are orthogonal]]
- [[ğŸ“— Deriving the time-independent Schrodinger equation]] can be done via [[ğŸ“™ Separation of variables]]
