Reduced Dynamics are an approximation of the evolution of a [[quantum system]], where we have applied the [[📘 Partial Trace]] over the environment.

More formally, this is a [[📘 Quantum Dynamical Semigroup]] $\{T_t \}_{t \geq 0}$ that attempts to make the diagram below commutative. This is only an attempt, as the [[📘 Reduced system]] does not contain all the information needed for commutativity to hold.

$$
\begin{CD}
\rho_0 @>{U_t \cdot U_t^\dagger}>\text{Unitarily}> \rho_t\\
@V\mathrm{Tr}^E[ \cdot ]VV @VV\mathrm{Tr}^E[ \cdot ]V \\
\rho_{S,0} @>{T_t}>\text{Reduced Dynamics}> \rho_{S,t}
\end{CD}
$$

Where we use the notation:
- $\rho_0$ for the initial [[📘 Density Operator]] of the full system
- $\rho_t := U_t\rho_0U_t^\dagger$ for the evolving [[📘 Density Operator]] of the full system.
- $\rho_{S,0}:= \mathrm{Tr}^E[\rho_0]$ for the initial [[📘 Density Operator]] of the [[📘 Reduced system]].
- $\rho_{S,t} := \mathrm{Tr}^E[\rho_t]$ for the evolving [[📘 Density Operator]] of the [[📘 Reduced system]].
- $\mathrm{Tr}^E[ \cdot]$ represents the [[📘 Partial Trace]] over the environment.
