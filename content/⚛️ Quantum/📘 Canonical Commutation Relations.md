$$[X_i, X_j] = 0$$
$$[P_i, P_j] = 0$$
$$[X_i, P_j] = i \hbar \delta_{ij}$$ 
Where
- $X_i$ is the [[ðŸ“˜ Position Operator]] on the ith dimension
- $P_j$ is the [[ðŸ“˜ Momentum Operator]] on the jth dimension.
- $\hbar$ is [[ðŸ“˜ Planck's reduced constant]]. 
- $\delta_{ij} = \mathbb{I}_{ \{ i=j \} }$ is the [[Kronecker delta]]
