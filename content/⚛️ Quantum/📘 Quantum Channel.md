A Trace Preserving [[ğŸ“˜ Dynamical Map]] $\Phi$. The trace preserving property means that for any [[ğŸ“˜ Density Operator]] $\rho$, which by definition has [[Trace]] 1, the [[ğŸ“˜ Density Operator]] $\Phi [\rho]$ also has [[Trace]] 1.

[[ğŸ“˜ Quantum Channel]]s are often referred to as CPTP Maps, since they are [[ğŸ“˜ Completely Positive]] Trace Preserving [[ğŸ“˜ Dynamical Map]]s.
