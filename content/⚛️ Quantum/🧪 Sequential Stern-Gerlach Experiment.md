The sequential Stern-Gerlach Experiment applies the same setup as the [[ğŸ§ª Stern-Gerlach Experiment]] sequentially, along different axes. We setup three cases:

# Cases
## ZZ
We perform a [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement]] of the [[electron spin]] along the $z$ axis 2 times. After the 1st [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement]], we block all atoms with negative spin $z_-$. During the 2nd [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement]] all atoms have [[magnetic moment]] $z_+$.

## ZX
We perform a [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement]] of the [[electron spin]] along the $z$ axis followed by the $x$ axis. After the 1st [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement]], we block all atoms with negative spin $z_-$. During the 2nd [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement]], we observe atoms with [[magnetic moment]] matching both $x_+$ and $x_-$.

## ZXZ
Similar to the 2nd case, followed by blocking atoms with a $x_-$ [[magnetic moment]] and adding an extra [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement]] of the [[magnetic moment]] along the $z$ axis. Since we blocked any atoms with [[magnetic moment]] equal to $z_-$ after the 1st [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement]], we would expect no such atoms to be seen during the 3rd [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement]]. This does not match observations.
