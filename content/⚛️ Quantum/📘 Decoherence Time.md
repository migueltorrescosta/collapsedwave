$\tau := \frac{2}{(e_i - e_j)^2}$  is known as the decoherence time. This term shows up during the evolution of a [[ðŸ“˜ Reduced system]], where the entry $\rho_{ij}$ of the [[ðŸ“˜ Density Operator]] is given by $\rho_{ij}(t) = \rho_{ij}(0) e^{-\frac{1}{2}(e_i-e_j)^2t} = \rho_{ij}(0)e^{t \tau_{ij}^{-1}}$.

The shorter the decoherence time, the faster our system's [[ðŸ“˜ Density Operator|Density Matrix]] moves towards the diagonal.
