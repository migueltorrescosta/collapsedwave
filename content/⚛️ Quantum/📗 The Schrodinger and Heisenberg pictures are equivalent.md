The [[Schrodinger picture]] and [[Heisenberg picture]] are equivalent, in the sense that we obtain the same results from either. Results are observed through [[ðŸ“˜ Measurement]], so this result means that [[ðŸ“˜ Measurement]]s are consistent across pictures

# Proof
In the [[Heisenberg picture]], we consider the [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum state]] $\psi$ fixed and the [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum observable]] $A(t)$ evolves in time. In this picture:
- a measurement is given by $\braket{A(t)}_\psi := \braket{\psi, A(t) \psi}$.
- $A(t)$ evolves according to the equation $A(t)=e^{\frac{itH}{\hbar}}Ae^{-\frac{itH}{\hbar}}$

In the [[Schrodinger picture]], we consider the [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum observable]] $A$ to be time independent and the [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum state]] $\psi(t)$ to evolve over time. In this picture:
- a measurement is given by $\braket{A}_{\psi(t)} := \braket{\psi(t), A \psi(t)}$.
- $\psi(t)$ evolves according to the equation $\psi(t)=e^{-\frac{itH}{\hbar}}\psi(0)$.

As such
$$
\begin{array}{rll}
\braket{A(t)}_\psi &= \braket{\psi, A(t) \psi} & \text{By the Heisenberg picture}\\
&= \braket{\psi, e^{\frac{itH}{\hbar}}Ae^{-\frac{itH}{\hbar}} \psi} & \text{Moving the operator based on antilinearity}\\
&= \braket{-e^{\frac{itH}{\hbar}} \psi, Ae^{-\frac{itH}{\hbar}} \psi} & \text{By the Schrodinger picture} \\ 
&= \braket{ \psi(t), A \psi(t)} & \text{By definition of a measurement}\\
&= \braket{A}_{\psi(t)}
\end{array}
$$
