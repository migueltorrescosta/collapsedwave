A Bose-Einstein condensate is created when a sparse gas made of bosons is brought close to near zero temperature. This construction is useful because in these conditions many of the bosons occupy the [[quantum system state]] of lowest energy, leading to macroscopic observations of quantum mechanical phenomena.
