A Bose-Einstein condensate is created when a sparse gas made of [[Boson]]s is brought close to near zero temperature. This construction is useful because in these conditions many of the [[Boson]]s occupy the [[quantum system state]] of lowest [[energy]], leading to macroscopic observations of quantum mechanical phenomena.
