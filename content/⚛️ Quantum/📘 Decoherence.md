A process by which [[üìò Coherence]]s are lost.

>[!warning]

>  Let $\hat\rho_2 = \frac{\ket{+}\bra{+} \quad + \quad \ket{-}\bra{-}}{2}$, where $\ket{\pm} = \frac{\ket{0}\pm\ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}$. Then $\hat\rho_2$ is represented in the $\{ \ket{0}, \ket{1} \}$ basis as $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \\ \end{pmatrix}$. The calculatulation for this is unclear. [[Help me ‚ùì]]
