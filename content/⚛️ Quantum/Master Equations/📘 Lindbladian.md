System described by a [[📘 Master equation]] of the form $\frac{d}{dt}\rho_t = \mathbb{L}[\rho] = - \frac{i}{\hbar} [ \hat H, \hat \rho ] + \sum_{\alpha = 1}^{N^2-1} L_\alpha (\hat K_\alpha \rho \hat K_\alpha^\dagger - \frac{1}{2} \{ \hat K_\alpha^\dagger \hat K_\alpha, \hat \rho \} )$, where
- $\mathbb{L}$ is the [[📘 Quantum Dynamical Semigroup generator]]
- $L_\alpha := \sqrt{C_\alpha} \hat K_\alpha$  are the [[📘 Lindblad Operator]]s.
- $C_\alpha$ are [[positive operator]]s. This follows from the [[📘 Quantum Dynamical Semigroup]] generated by $\mathbb{L}$ being [[📘 Completely Positive]]. I need to write down this proof. [[Help me ❓]]

The Lindbladian generalises the [[📕 Postulate 4 - Schrodinger Equation]] to an [[open quantum system]] $S$. In [[open quantum system]]s the noise introduced by the environment changes the dynamics of the system, requiring the addition of "adjustment" terms. These adjustments make [[📘 Unitary Operator]]s unfit to describe a [[open quantum system]], requiring us to use more general [[📘 Operator]]s.
