$\mathbb{V}_A \subset \mathbb{V}_{1 \otimes 2}$  is known as the Fermionic Hilbert Space, where
- $V_{1 \otimes 2}$ is the 2-particle [[📘 Quantum Hilbert Space]]
- $\mathbb{V}_A$ is the subspace of [[anti-symmetric]] [[📘 Quantum state]], i.e. states $\ket{\psi(a,b)}$ where $\psi(a,b) = - \psi(b,a)$. This subspace describes all [[Fermion]]s.
