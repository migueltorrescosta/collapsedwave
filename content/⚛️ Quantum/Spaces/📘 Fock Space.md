$F_\nu(H) := \overline{\bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty}S_\nu H^{\bigotimes n}}$ , where

- $H^{ \bigotimes n}$ represents an [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum Hilbert Space]] with $n$ particles
- $S_\nu$ represents the symmetrization or antisymetrization of a [[tensor]], i.e. $S_\nu(H)$ is the set of all symmetric ( anti symmetric ) [[tensor]]s acting on an [[ðŸ“˜ Hilbert Space]] $H$.
	- Symmetric tensors are needed for [[bosonic statistics]]
	- Anti symmetric tensors are needed for [[fermionic statistics]]
- $\bigoplus$ describes the [[ðŸ“˜ Direct Sum]] of [[ðŸ“˜ Hilbert Space]]s
- $\overline{V}$ represents the [[closure]] of a [[ðŸ“˜ Hilbert Space]] $V$.

The fock space allows us to act on spaces with a varying number of particles through the use of [[annihilation operator]]s and [[creation operator]]s.
