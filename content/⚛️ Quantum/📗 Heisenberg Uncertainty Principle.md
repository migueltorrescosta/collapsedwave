$( \Delta_\psi X ) ( \Delta_\psi P ) \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$

The above shows that the product of [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement uncertainty]] between the [[ğŸ“˜ Position Operator]] and the [[ğŸ“˜ Momentum Operator]] is bounded below. The relation applies to any pair of [[ğŸ“˜ Conjugate variable]]s, and follows from the [[ğŸ“— Fourier Uncertainty Principle]], since [[ğŸ“˜ Conjugate variable]]s are related to each other by being the [[ğŸ“˜ Fourier Transform]] of each other, up to a constant defined in terms of [[ğŸ“˜ Planck's reduced constant]] $\hbar$ .

- $X$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Position Operator]]
- $P$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Momentum Operator]]
- $\psi \in H$ is a [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum state vector]]
- $\Delta_\psi$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement uncertainty]] of an [[ğŸ“˜ Operator]] for the [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum state vector]] $\psi$.
- $\hbar$ is [[ğŸ“˜ Planck's reduced constant]]
