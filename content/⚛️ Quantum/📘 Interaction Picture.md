The [[ğŸ“˜ Interaction Picture]] stands between the [[Schrodinger picture]] and [[Heisenberg picture]], as it considers both time evolving [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum state]]s and time evolving [[ğŸ“˜ Operator]]s. This is useful when numerically solving [[quantum system]]s by using approximations, as we can evolve our [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum state]]s and [[ğŸ“˜ Operator]]s according to [[interaction terms]].
