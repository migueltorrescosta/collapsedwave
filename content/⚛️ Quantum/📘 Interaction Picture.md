The [[ðŸ“˜ Interaction Picture]] stands between the [[Schrodinger picture]] and [[Heisenberg picture]], as it considers both time evolving [[quantum state vector]]s and time evolving [[ðŸ“˜ Operator]]s. This is useful when numerically solving [[quantum system]]s by using approximations, as we can evolve our [[quantum state vector]]s and [[ðŸ“˜ Operator]]s according to [[interaction terms]].
