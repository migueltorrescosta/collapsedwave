$( \Delta_\psi A )^2 := \braket{ ( A - \braket{A}_\psi I)^2} = \braket{A^2}_\psi - ( {A}_\psi )^2$, where
- $A: H \rightarrow H$ is a [[ğŸ“˜ Self-Adjoint Operator]]
- $\psi \in H$ is a [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum state]]
- $\braket{A}_\psi$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Expectation]] of $A$ given the [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum state]] $\psi$
- $I$ is the identity matrix

The value $\Delta_\psi A$ is known as the uncertainty of [[ğŸ“˜ Measurement]] $A$ in the state $\psi$. The evolution of Measurement uncertainty is described by the [[ğŸ“— Heisenberg Equation of Motion]]
