$( \Delta_\psi A )^2 := \braket{ ( A - \braket{A}_\psi I)^2} = \braket{A^2}_\psi - ( {A}_\psi )^2$

The value $\Delta_\psi A$ is known as the uncertainty of [[measurement]] $A$ in the state $\psi$.

>[!info]-
> 1. $A: H \rightarrow H$ is a [[ğŸ“˜ Self-Adjoint Operator]]
> 2. $\psi \in H$ is a [[quantum state vector]]
> 3. $\braket{A}_\psi$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Expectation]] of $A$ given the [[quantum state vector]] $\psi$
> 4. $I$ is the identity matrix

The evolution of Measurement uncertainty is described by the [[ğŸ“— Heisenberg Equation of Motion]]
