$( \Delta_\psi A )^2 := \braket{ ( A - \braket{A}_\psi I)^2} = \braket{A^2}_\psi - ( {A}_\psi )^2$, where
- $A: H \rightarrow H$ is a [[ðŸ“˜ Self-Adjoint Operator]]
- $\psi \in H$ is a [[quantum state vector]]
- $\braket{A}_\psi$ is the [[ðŸ“˜ Expectation]] of $A$ given the [[quantum state vector]] $\psi$
- $I$ is the identity matrix

The value $\Delta_\psi A$ is known as the uncertainty of [[measurement]] $A$ in the state $\psi$. The evolution of Measurement uncertainty is described by the [[ðŸ“— Heisenberg Equation of Motion]]
