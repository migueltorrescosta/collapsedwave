An unravelling maps a time-evolved [[📘 Statistical Operator|Density Matrix]] $\rho_t$ to it's [[quantum state vector]] $\ket{\psi_S(t)}$. Unravellings lose information about [[📘 Coherence]]s that are only kept in a [[📘 Statistical Operator|Density Matrix]], and as such they might be a poor representation of a [[quantum system]].

The same [[📘 Master equation]] $\frac{d}{dt}\rho_t = H$ have at least one associated unravelling, and can potentially have infinitely many unravellings. I need to better understand why. [[Help me ❓]]
