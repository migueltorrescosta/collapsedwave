$i \hbar \dot \psi = H \psi$ defines the time evolution of a [[quantum state vector]] $\psi$

Different systems make use of the above equation by specifying different [[📘 Hamiltonian Operator]]s. As an example, the Schrodinger equation for a single non-relativistic particle under a time dependent potential $V(x,t)$ is given by: $$ih\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \left [ - \frac{h}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t) \right ] \Psi(x,t) $$

> - $V$ is the [[📘 Potential energy]]

I need to find the best way of splitting the above postulates into multiple files. [[Help me ❓]]
