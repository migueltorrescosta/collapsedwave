Physically, a coherent state is obtained from the quantum equivalent of an [[📘 Harmonic Oscillator]]. Mathematically, we often describe a [[📘 Statistical Operator]] with non-zero [[📘 Coherence]] as a coherent state.

I still need to flesh out the exact definition of Coherent state, as a few similar definitions have been used for this term. [[Help me ❓]]
