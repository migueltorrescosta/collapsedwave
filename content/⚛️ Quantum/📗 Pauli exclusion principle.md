Two [[Fermion]]s cannot be in the same [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum state]] $\ket{a}$.

# Proof
Let $\ket{a}$ be the [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum state]] of a [[Fermion]]. Then
$$
\begin{array}{rll}
\ket{\psi(a,a)} &= -\ket{\psi(a,a)} & \text{Due to the anti-symmetry of fermions}\\
&\Downarrow \\
\ket{\psi(a,a)}&=0 \\
\end{array}
$$
However this is an impossible state since it does not have [[ðŸ“˜ Norm]] 1.
