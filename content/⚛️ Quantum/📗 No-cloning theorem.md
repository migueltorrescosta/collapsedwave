It is impossible to create an independent copy of a given [[qubit]] in an unknown state $\ket{\psi}$.

# Proof

All actions on a [[ðŸ“˜ Quantum Hilbert Space]] can be represented by unitary operators. The map $\ket{\psi} \times \ket{\phi} \rightarrow \ket{\psi} \times \ket{\psi}$, mapping $H^2 \mapsto H^2$ is not unitary. Hence, there is no transformation that clones a [[qubit]].
