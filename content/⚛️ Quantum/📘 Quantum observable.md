An operator $\hat{f}$ on the [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum Hilbert Space]] corresponding to a [[ğŸ“˜ Classical observable]] $f$, as per the [[ğŸ“• Postulate 2]] of Quantum Mechanics, where
- $\mathscr{H}$ is the [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum Hilbert Space]]
- $f : \mathbb{R}^{2n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a [[ğŸ“˜ Classical observable]]
- $\hat{f}: \mathscr{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the corresponding [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum observable]]

The act of generating [[ğŸ“˜ Quantum observable]] from [[ğŸ“˜ Classical observable]] is known as [[Quantization]].
