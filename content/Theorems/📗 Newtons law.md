The relation $F=ma$ between [[force]], [[mass]] and [[acceleration]]  . Technically this is Newton's 2nd law, however it is often referred to as Newton's law since it is the most commonly mentioned one.

We often write Newton's law as $m \ddot x = F(x, \dot x)$, given a [[force]] $F : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$.
