$( \Delta_\psi X ) ( \Delta_\psi P ) > \frac{\hbar}{2}$
### ✍️ Notation
- $X$ is the [[📘 Position Operator]]
- $P$ is the [[📘 Momentum Operator]]
- $\psi \in H$ is a [[quantum state vector]]
- $\Delta_\psi$ is the [[📘 Measurement uncertainty]] of an [[Operator]] for the [[quantum state vector]] $\psi$.
- $\hbar$ is [[Plancks reduced constant]]
