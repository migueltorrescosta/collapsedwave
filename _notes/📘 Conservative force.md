A [[force]] $F$ is called conservative iff $\exists V: F = - \nabla V$
### ✍️ Notation
- $V$ is the associated [[📘 Potential energy]]
- $\nabla V$ is the [[📘 Del or Nabla]] of $V$
### 💭 Intuition
For a [[force]] $F(x) : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ with no dependency on the [[velocity]] $v = \dot x$, [[📘 Total Energy]] is constant only if the [[force]] is conservative
