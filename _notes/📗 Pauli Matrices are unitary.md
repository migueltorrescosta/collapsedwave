$\sigma_x \sigma_x^* = \sigma_x^* \sigma_x = \sigma_y^* \sigma_y = \sigma_y \sigma_y^* = \sigma_z \sigma_z^* = \sigma_z^* \sigma_z = I$ 
### ✍️  Notation
- $\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z$ are the [[📘 Pauli Matrices]]
- $A^*$ is the [[📘 Conjugate transpose]] of $A$

## 🧠 Proof
Follows since
- [[📗 Pauli Matrices are involutory]]
- [[📗 All involutory matrices are unitary]]
