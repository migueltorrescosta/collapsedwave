For an [[Operator]] $A$, it's adjoint $A^*: H \rightarrow H$  is defined by the relation $\braket{Ax, y} = \braket{x, A^* y} \forall x,y \in H$. Uniqueness and existence of $A^*$ are assured by [[Riesz Representation Theorem]]
### ✍️ Notation
- $H$ is an [[Hilbert Space]] 
- $\braket{ \cdot , \cdot }$ is an [[Inner Product]] on $H$
- $A$ is an [[Operator]]
