$p(x) > 0 \forall x \in X$ 

### ✍️  Notation
- $X$ is a [[vector field]]
- $p$ is a [[📘 Norm]]

### 🧠 Proof
- Since a norm satisfies the [[triangle inequality]], $p(0) \leq p(x) + p(-x)$.
- By [[absolute homogeneity]] , $p(-x) = \| 1 \| p(x) = p(x)$ 
- By [[absolute homogeneity]] , $p(0) = \| 0 \| p(0) = 0$ 
- Joining results, $0=p(0) \leq p(x) + p(-x) = 2p(x)$, so $p(x) \geq 0$
